Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is an electronic component that allows you to create digital integrated circuits using programming.
Unlike conventional digital chips, the logic of FPGA operation is not determined during manufacture.
The FPGA consists of logic elements such as AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, NOT, etc., as well as D and T type triggers. And logic elements are built on the basis of transistors

A chip is a set of components that perform various functions, while they are combined into a common circuit.

The chip includes:
1. Transistors. These are the main semiconductor elements that help in creating logic circuits.
2. Capacitors. These devices accumulate and store an electric charge.
3. Resistors. Passive elements of microchips. They are responsible for the differentiation and absorption of the current flow.
4. Diodes.

A LUT (Look-Up Table) is a conversion table that is used in FPGA. You can use it to implement any logical function.
The LUT consists of 1-bit memory cells and multiplexers. When a combination of digital signals is applied to the LUT inputs,
it perceives them as an address and outputs the contents of the cell at this address.
Thus, LUT is needed in microchips to increase the speed of the control circuit and implement peak current control
